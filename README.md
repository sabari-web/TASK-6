# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation Report

## 📝 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand the principles of password security, create passwords with varying complexity, test their strength using online tools, and evaluate best practices for creating strong passwords.

---

## ✅ Steps Followed

### **Step 1: Understand Password Strength**
A strong password typically includes:
- ✅ At least 12 characters in length
- ✅ A mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- ✅ No use of dictionary words or personal information
- ✅ No reuse across multiple accounts

---

### **Step 2: Created Multiple Passwords**
Passwords were created with varying levels of complexity to demonstrate different strengths.

### **Step 3: Tested Passwords**
Each password was tested using online tools such as:
- [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)

## 📊 Password Strength Table

| **Password**           | **Strength**   | **Description**                                           |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `erick12345`           | Good           | Mix of lowercase and numbers, 10 characters               |
| `erickkill`            | Very Weak      | Letters only, 9 characters                                |
| `erick@90934`          | Very Strong    | Mix of lowercase, numbers, and symbols, 11 characters     |
| `erick123`             | Weak           | Mix of lowercase and numbers, 8 characters                |
| `erick@kill2367@23`    | Very Strong    | Mix of lowercase, numbers, and symbols, 17 characters     |

## 🔍 Analysis & Best Practices

### **Best Practices Learned:**
- Use **at least 12 characters**
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols**
- Avoid **predictable patterns** (like `123456`)
- Don’t use **personal information**
- Prefer **random phrases or use a password manager**

## 🛡️ Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force:** Tries every possible combination; longer, complex passwords take longer to crack.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words; avoid dictionary-based passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked credentials from other sites; always use unique passwords.
- **Phishing:** Tries to trick users into revealing their password; unrelated to strength but very dangerous.

## 📌 Conclusion

By analyzing password complexity and evaluating results from trusted tools, we gain a better understanding of how secure our passwords are. Creating complex, unique, and long passwords dramatically increases resistance to common cyberattacks.
